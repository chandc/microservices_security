1.	Incident commander name
•	Unauthorized crypto mining jobs detected in the system
2.	Executive summary of what happened
•	Three pods running crypto mining software, namely moneropool, 
minergate and minergate, have been launched in the Kubernetes cluster. 
They caused the CPU load to rise to over 90% and started 
slowing down the system.
3.	Summary of what was affected
•	Unauthorized crypto mining software consumed a large amount of 
computing resources. It was detected in the Grafana dashboard. 
The system became unresponsive and unusable.
4.	Summary of the impact
•	High CPU consumption by crypto mining software caused poor 
user experience. If it is not dealt with in a timely manner, 
it can cause the system to crash.
5.	Summary of the remediation steps
•	System administrator had detected 3 unauthorized pods in Grafana. 
He took the action to evict them from the cluster using the 
kubectl command and confirmed in the Grafana dashboard that 
CPU load dropped back down to the expected level.
6.	Summary of lessons learned
•	We need to implement a control to allow certain images to be 
imported and started in each pod. It was good to be able to monitor 
the cluster health through Grafana dashboard. We should consider 
adding Falcon rules to alert the presence of crypto mining software.
